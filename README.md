# 3D-printing-Slicer

In Python, this code shows how a Slicer software takes a stl file and converts toa gcode to 3D print. For this project, a vase was 3D printed. The input to the python program 
was a stl file, printer temperatures,extruder speed and movement speed and it ouput a gcode file which is the instructions for for the printer to produce a 3D model vase. 
With the octoPi software, I remotely 3D printed the vase to a Ender 3D printer with a raspberry pi.
